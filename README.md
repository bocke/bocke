### About me

Hi! My name is Bojan ([ðŸ”Š](https://forvo.com/word/bojan/)). If that seems hard to pronounce, you can call me Ben. It's similar enough. ðŸ˜‰

I'm an IT and FOSS enthusiast from Serbia, South-Eastern Europe. I've been interested in computers since I was 9. My first computer was a PC clone with 386sx, Hercules mono graphics and 1 MB of ram. That might give you a clue how old I am. ðŸ˜€

TODO: Write something about my technical background and interests.
