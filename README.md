### AI-Assisted Development Experiments

Over the past year I’ve been experimenting with AI-driven development. It’s a long topic and I have plenty of thoughts about it, but here’s the short version: AI isn’t replacing developers anytime soon, but it can be genuinely helpful, especially on smaller, well-defined tasks.

To test this properly, I tried building a bunch of different things with AI support:
text editors (console and GUI), file managers, a man-page viewer, a small Markdown authoring tool, and a few other utilities. I also experimented with using AI to debug code, add new features, adapt existing projects, and even generate shell scripts (which works, but you really have to double-check everything).

Some of these projects might get released at some point once I clean them up. The basic code is there; it just needs some shaping before it’s ready for the world.

One thing I noticed is that AI’s usefulness drops as a project grows in size or complexity. At that point you basically switch back to human-led development and use the AI as a helper, someone to ask for a quick review, bounce ideas off, or help track down an odd bug. AI is also useful when exploring feature ideas, but only if you already know what you want.

So here’s my takeaway:
- AI as a fully automatic programmer: not reliable.
- AI as a helper for small tasks: very good.
- AI as a learning tool: surprisingly effective, especially if you already know the basics and ask the right questions.

This section of text is genuinely written by me, but I did use AI to improve it stylistically. I just noticed it inserted em dashes, which is funny knowing that the whole section is about my personal impressions about AI. Em Dashes removed from the last revision.

## News
- 2025.11.08. - I actually broke GitHub stars by having more than 5k stars. I had to remove some to acces the rest. For the more important ones, I ended up either saving the content locally on the disk or documenting them via [Zread.ai](https://zread.ai/). 5k is too much to manage manually, so I don't know what to do except to ocassionaly remove some in passing.
