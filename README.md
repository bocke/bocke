## News
- 2025.11.08. - I actually broke GitHub stars by having more than 5k stars. I had to remove some to acces the rest. For the more important ones, I ended up either saving the content locally on the disk or documenting them via [Zread.ai](https://zread.ai/). 5k is too much to manage manually, so I don't know what to do except to ocassionaly remove some in passing.

> ⚙️ Always curious about how things work, how to break them and then fix them again.

 - If this reads as an AI, it partially is (based on pre-prepared data). I tried to edit it a bit, but am still not super happy with it.
