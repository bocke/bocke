### About me

Hi! My name is Bojan ([ðŸ”Š](https://forvo.com/word/bojan/)). If that seems hard to pronounce, you can call me Ben. It's similar enough. ðŸ˜‰

 * An IT and FOSS enthusiast from Serbia, South-Eastern Europe. I've been interested in computers since I was 9. My first computer was a PC clone with 386sx, Hercules mono graphics and 1 MB of ram. That might give you a clue how old I am. ðŸ˜€

 * A (mostly) self-tought amateur programmer. I am most familiar with C and POSIX shell script, but I have written the code in other languages too (C++, Pascal, Basic, PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, SQL, some assembly). 

 * A Linux user since 1999. I use Slackware Linux. I do ocassionaly test new and trendy stuff on spare computers (including other distros), but mostly from Slackware POV: "How to bring this new cool thing to Slackware?" or "Will this fit Slackware philosophy?". 

 * A long time moderator and contributor to MyCity.rs internet forums and one of the admins of Slackware Serbia online community. I ocassionaly contribute to SlackBuilds.org.

 * Holds several IT certificates over time: CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Linux+ and LPIC-1.

 * A collector of retro computers. I have a small collection of Amiga, Atari, Apple, Commodore and PC computers. I am also a fan of retro revival scene, but am not happy about the price increase this revival brings. ðŸ˜€ 

 * Also interested in emulation (retro or not). While WINE is not an emulator, I know a few tricks. ðŸ˜‰ 

 * A noob in electronics, but I am interested in whole hobby electronics "Maker movement". In my TODO list are Arduino and RPi Pico based projects. I am also interested in retro hardware projects and retro inspired or replica homebrew retro computers.
