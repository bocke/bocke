## News
- 2025.11.08. - I actually broke GitHub stars by having more than 5k stars. I had to remove some to acces the rest. For the more important ones, I ended up either saving the content locally on the disk or documenting them via [Zread.ai](https://zread.ai/). 5k is too much to manage manually, so I don't know what to do except to ocassionaly remove some in passing.
